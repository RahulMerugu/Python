#This is related to the Modules and is purely for learning how to import functions from files that are present within another folder


from Modules import Modules1
Modules1.dog()

#here, Modules1 is the name of the file, and dog is the name of the funstion that was pulled from the file.

# this part can also written like:
#from Modules1 import dog
#bark()    [All this was beforei created a folder name Modules, so now, since there is Modules, the part not in green is correct and the one in green is for when there is no folder separating them.]

#you will get the same output.
